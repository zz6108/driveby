# Disclaimer - WORK IN PROGRESS
driveby works as of now, but code cleanup & figuring out bugs & etc is still ongoing - use at your own risk until proper release!

# What is driveby?
> driveby is a small addon to grabbing `Hidden Caches` & smashing `Beast Nests` just a single click!
> Driveby automatically uses the best key/bait you possess, or just smashes the Cache/Nest, all you need to do is click the Cache/Nest!

This is how easy it is to use.
